        Ritesh Agarwal has had an interesting childhood. He was never fond of studies so he dropped formal education out of his plans.The idea of Oravel Stays struck him when he was 18.The basic idea was a budget hotel chain that provides B&B. Realizing that no other service offered a room for a budget traveller,Ritesh took the idea from Oravel stays to OYO rooms and voila! Agarwal started OYO with 11 only rooms in a Gurgaon hotel.Today, OYO has 65000 rooms in about 5500 properties across 170 cities in India.
